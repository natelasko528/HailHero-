- **GoHighLevel**: CRM integration and contact management
- **NOAA/NCEI**: Storm events data
- **OpenAddresses**: Property address datasets
- **OpenStreetMap/Nominatim**: Geocoding services

## Critical Implementation Details

### Configuration Management
The system uses a sophisticated configuration system (`src/config.py`) with:
- Dataclass-based configuration structure
- Environment variable overrides
- Validation and error checking
- Separate configs for development and production
- Geographic constraints for data processing

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Event Detection**: NOAA API ingestion of hail storm data
2. **Property Identification**: Geospatial intersection with address databases
3. **Lead Generation**: Creation of candidate leads with scoring
4. **Enrichment**: Contact and property data enhancement
5. **Distribution**: Lead assignment to field representatives
6. **Inspection**: Mobile workflow for damage assessment
7. **Integration**: Push to CRM and messaging systems

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Provenance**: Track source of all enriched data
- **Consent Management**: Store consent records for all contacts
- **Do Not Contact**: Respect DNC flags and compliance requirements
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logging for compliance evidence
- **Privacy**: No mock PII, explicit consent flows required

## Development Best Practices
